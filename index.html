          I’m proficient with computers and technology in general. I have 8+
          years of experience working with Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, and IOS
          operating systems. Currently I’m able to code in java, c, and python,
          but I’m working towards learning more about programming. I’m also
          skilled in circuit design and electronic repair. I’ve worked a lot
          with soldering irons and hot air rework stations. Something I’ve
          recently learned is
          <abbr title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</abbr> modeling using Fusion
          360, which I’ve been using to create 3D printable objects.

        <p>
          A lot of my skills were generated as a result of the interests I have
          acquired throughout my life. I’ve always loved playing around with
          computers, taking electronics apart and seeing how they work, and
          creating things. I’m a big fan of
          <abbr title="Do it Yourself">DiY</abbr>, so much so that I get excited
          when things break around the house as that gives me an opportunity to
          try and fix them! Another major interest of mine is video gaming. I
          love modern games, but I've always been fascinated with retro consoles
          and their technology. The history behind video gaming and the hardware
          that came with it really lets you appreciate how far innovation has
          come.

          <p>
            Something I’ve been working on recently is repairing old and
            nonfunctional game consoles and handhelds. There’s a lot of people
            especially in Asia that are selling “junk” technology for very cheap
            online. So, I decided to order some interesting pieces and see if I
            could fix them and perhaps even turn a profit by reselling them.
            Some of the devices I’ve fixed up include various Nintendo handhelds
            and home consoles, Sega GameGears, Sony Playstations, and a Bandai
            Wonderswan. These devices had problems ranging from faulty power
            switches to full on water damage with corrosion that had eaten away
            traces in the circuit board.

            <h3>3D Modeling and Printing</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            Not too long ago I bought a 3D printer to help with some of the
            projects I like doing. Some of the immediate tasks I had were
            actually to improve the printer itself. 3D printers can be found
            significantly cheaper than before now, but it unfortunately comes at
            the cost of reliability, quality of life, and even safety in some
            cases. One of the improvements I made was to protect the wires going
            to the motors, heated bed, and hotend with a cable chain. The wires
            on these printers have to constantly flex and bend thousands of
            times while printing. Any sort of kink or snag in a wire can lead to
            it prematurely breaking, causing a short or in some extreme
            circumstances creating a fire. The cable chain allows the wires to
            bend evenly, helping to prevent future issues. I’ve also swapped out
            the stock cooling fans for quieter and more efficient ones, as well
            as installed a raspberry pi that allows me to monitor the status of
            prints through my phone.

            <h3>Automated Controller</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, there are some games where repeated actions are
            necessary in order to achieve some sort of goal. As anyone could
            expect, doing the same actions over and over again gets boring very
            quickly. One example of this that I encountered was in the new
            Pokemon for Nintendo Switch. In the world of pokemon, every monster
            in a species looks pretty much the same. However, there is an
            extremely small possibility that a pokemon can be found with a
            different color palette than its brethren. This is referred to as a
            shiney. Shinies are extremely rare but highly sought after for
            anyone playing the game. The only way to obtain these are by either
            finding one in the wild, trading someone for theirs, or by using the
            breeding mechanic in the game to hatch a shiny pokemon from an egg.
            For this project, I focused on that last method.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to breed a monster in the game you need to put the
            appropriate pokemon in the day care and move your character for an
            amount of time to trigger the egg generation and hatching
            respectively. I wanted to create a way to automate this so that I
            didn’t need to physically play the game and do these steps
            repeatedly. After some research I found that something similar was
            used in another game, validating that what I wanted to do was
            feasible.
          </p>

            To interact with a Switch, there needs to be some sort of peripheral
            attached that acts like a controller which can be recognized by the
            console. For this, an arduino microcontroller is used in combination
            with a USB to serial TTL adapter. I modified the existing code to
            work with my particular configuration. Once that was done, I now had
            to create the looping set of instructions that the in game character
            would perform. After a lot of trial and error I was finally able to
            get it working. This project was really fun as I was able to learn a
            lot of programming while doing something I really enjoyed.
