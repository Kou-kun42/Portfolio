                    I’m proficient with computers and technology in general.  I have 8+ years of experience working with Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, and IOS operating systems.  Currently I’m able to code in java, c, and python, but I’m working towards learning more about programming.  I’m also skilled in circuit design and electronic repair.  I’ve worked a lot with soldering irons and hot air rework stations.  Something I’ve recently learned is CAD modeling using Fusion 360, which I’ve been using to create 3D printable objects.

                    A lot of my skills were generated as a result of the interests I have acquired throughout my life.  I’ve always loved playing around with computers, taking electronics apart and seeing how they work, and creating things.  I’m a big fan of DiY, so much so that I get excited when things break around the house as that gives me an opportunity to try and fix them!  Another major interest of mine is video gaming.  I love modern games, but I've always been fascinated with retro consoles and their technology.  The history behind video gaming and the hardware that came with it really lets you appreciate how far innovation has come.

                        Something I’ve been working on recently is repairing old and nonfunctional game consoles and handhelds.  There’s a lot of people especially in Asia that are selling “junk” technology for very cheap online.  So, I decided to order some interesting pieces and see if I could fix them and perhaps even turn a profit by reselling them.  Some of the devices I’ve fixed up include various Nintendo handhelds and home consoles, Sega GameGears, Sony Playstations, and a Bandai Wonderswan.  These devices had problems ranging from faulty power switches to full on water damage with corrosion that had eaten away traces in the circuit board.

                        Not too long ago I bought a 3D printer to help with some of the projects I like doing.  Some of the immediate tasks I had were actually to improve the printer itself.  3D printers can be found significantly cheaper than before now, but it unfortunately comes at the cost of reliability, quality of life, and even safety in some cases.  One of the improvements I made was to protect the wires going to the motors, heated bed, and hotend with a cable chain.  The wires on these printers have to constantly flex and bend thousands of times while printing.  Any sort of kink or snag in a wire can lead to it prematurely breaking, causing a short or in some extreme circumstances creating a fire.  The cable chain allows the wires to bend evenly, helping to prevent future issues.  I’ve also swapped out the stock cooling fans for quieter and more efficient ones, as well as installed a raspberry pi that allows me to monitor the status of prints through my phone.

                        Unfortunately, there are some games where repeated actions are necessary in order to achieve some sort of goal.  As anyone could expect, doing the same actions over and over again gets boring very quickly.  One example of this that I encountered was in the new Pokemon for Nintendo Switch.  In the world of pokemon, every monster in a species looks pretty much the same.  However, there is an extremely small possibility that a pokemon can be found with a different color palette than its brethren.  This is referred to as a shiney.  Shinies are extremely rare but highly sought after for anyone playing the game.  The only way to obtain these are by either finding one in the wild, trading someone for theirs, or by using the breeding mechanic in the game to hatch a shiny pokemon from an egg.  For this project, I focused on that last method.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to breed a monster in the game you need to put the appropriate pokemon in the day care and move your character for an amount of time to trigger the egg generation and hatching respectively.  I wanted to create a way to automate this so that I didn’t need to physically play the game and do these steps repeatedly.  After some research I found that something similar was used in another game, validating that what I wanted to do was feasible.

                        To interact with a Switch, there needs to be some sort of peripheral attached that acts like a controller which can be recognized by the console.  For this, an arduino microcontroller is used in combination with a USB to serial TTL adapter.  I modified the existing code to work with my particular configuration.  Once that was done, I now had to create the looping set of instructions that the in game character would perform.  After a lot of trial and error I was finally able to get it working.  This project was really fun as I was able to learn a lot of programming while doing something I really enjoyed.
